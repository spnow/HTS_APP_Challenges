Instead of modifying binary file, I just set up a DNS poisoner to fish the app
query to our local http server and get "true".

Two VMs - Ubuntu (router & local DNS server) + Windows (app3win.exe execution)

  python -m http.server
  ./app3win.start
  # execute app3win.exe in Windows host
  ./app3win.stop
