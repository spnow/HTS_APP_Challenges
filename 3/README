This challenge tries to contact authentication server for status, more
specifically it connects to /missions/application/app3/auth.php

Default return status is "false" and there seems no easy way to overwrite this
behavior.

There is one simple way to bypass this check by modifying the check value
within the program, Google it.

Instead of modifying binary file, I just set up a DNS poisoner to fish the app
query to our local http server and get "true".

# Windows need to be setup using Ubuntu Host as Gateway & DNS server.

Two VMs - Ubuntu (router & local DNS server) + Windows (app3win.exe execution)

  sudo ./spoof.sh start
  # execute app3win.exe in Windows host
  # Ctrl+C on bash to kill app3win.start
  sudo ./spoof.sh stop
