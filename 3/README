Instead of modifying binary file, I just set up a DNS poisoner to fish the app
query to our local http server and get "true".

# Windows need to be setup using Ubuntu Host as Gateway & DNS server.

Two VMs - Ubuntu (router & local DNS server) + Windows (app3win.exe execution)

  sudo ./app3win.start
  # execute app3win.exe in Windows host
  # Ctrl+C on bash to kill app3win.start
  sudo ./app3win.stop
