This challenge basically 
  1. takes the input
  2. sum ASCII values of each
  3. uses this sum as a key and magic number from app7win.enc file to feed a
     transformation process to see if the result is 3530.

Simple brute force would find the ASCII sum and you can come up with any ASCII
input whose sum is this.

Note: The challenge program use getc function to read one char at a time, and
check char against '\n' to end input process. However, '\n' is also fed into
the sum. So you need to subtract '\n' from the sum.
